# Roadmap: Affiliate Marketing Integration (Lazada & Shopee)
# affiliate_marketing/Docs/Roadmap.md

This document outlines the plan to integrate affiliate marketing into the Django web app, with initial focus on Lazada, Shopee, and (optionally) Involve Asia, using a clean link‑tracking layer.

---

## Phase 1: Core Affiliate Link Tracking System

- [x] **1.1 – Model for Tracked Links**  
  Create `TrackedAffiliateLink` model (`original_url`, `slug`, `title`, `merchant`, `created_at`).  
  Add `AffiliateClick` model for click analytics (`link`, `ip`, `user_agent`, `referer`, `clicked_at`).

- [x] **1.2 – Redirect View & URL**  
  Implement `affiliate_redirect(request, slug)` that logs a click and redirects to `original_url`.  
  Wire it to `/out/<slug>/`.

- [x] **1.3 – Template Tag**  
  Build `{% affiliate_url slug %}` template tag to output the cloaked URL (e.g., `/out/best-mouse/`).

- [x] **1.4 – Admin Registration**  
  Register both models in Django admin for quick link management and click log inspection.

- [x] **1.5 – Manual Link Generation Flow**  
  Document how to obtain Lazada/Shopee affiliate links and create corresponding `TrackedAffiliateLink` entries (either via admin or a management command).  
  *Added CSV import management command (`import_affiliate_links`).*

---

## Phase 2: Lazada & Shopee Direct Affiliate Programs (Manual Links)

- [ ] **2.1 – Affiliate Account Sign‑up**  
  - Shopee: application submitted, under review (15–30 working days).  
  - Lazada: portal returned 502 error; retry later.  
  *Involve Asia publisher account approved and used as immediate alternative.*

- [ ] **2.2 – First Product Links**  
  - One real Shopee link generated via Involve Asia (`shopee-test`).  
  - Still need to build up to 5–10 links from each platform.

- [x] **2.3 – Disclosure & Compliance**  
  Added FTC‑style disclosure notice on deals page. All affiliate links use `rel="nofollow sponsored"`.

- [ ] **2.4 – Cookie & Policy Considerations**  
  Review whether click tracking stores personal data under GDPR/Philippine law; if needed, implement consent mechanism or IP anonymisation.

---

## Phase 3: Involve Asia Integration (Optional, Multi‑Merchant API)

- [x] **3.1 – Involve Asia Publisher Account**  
  - Account created, property Humrine.com approved.  
  - Shopee PH and Lazada Talent (PH) campaigns applied; Shopee auto‑approved, Lazada pending.

- [ ] **3.2 – API Client in Django**  
  - Service module `involve_api.py` written (with caching).  
  - **BLOCKED:** API key not available yet; request submitted to Involve, under review (up to 48 working hours).

- [ ] **3.3 – Dynamic Product Catalogue (Optional)**  
  Build a view that pulls live products from Involve Asia and renders them, each wrapped with our cloaked redirect.

- [ ] **3.4 – Fallback & Error Handling**  
  Graceful degradation if the API is unavailable; show cached data or a placeholder.

---

## Phase 4: Analytics Dashboard & Reporting

- [x] **4.1 – Basic Click Stats**  
  Created `/stats/` view with per‑link and daily click breakdowns.

- [x] **4.2 – Export & Filtering**  
  Added date range filters and CSV export to the stats dashboard.

- [ ] **4.3 – Conversion Attribution (Future)**  
  (Stretch) Integrate conversion pixels or server‑side postbacks if the networks support it.

---

## Phase 5: Own Affiliate Program (Inbound) – Future Scope

- [ ] **5.1 – Affiliate User Model**  
  `Affiliate` model linked to `User`, with `referral_code`, `commission_rate`, `total_earnings`.

- [ ] **5.2 – Referral Tracking**  
  Landing page `/ref/<code>/` that sets a cookie and logs a `ReferralClick`.  
  Attribute sign‑ups/purchases to the referring affiliate.

- [ ] **5.3 – Affiliate Dashboard**  
  Let affiliates view their clicks, conversions, and earnings.  
  Admin tools to mark payouts.

---

## Key Decisions & Architecture Notes

- **Link ownership:** All outbound affiliate links go through our own redirect (`/out/<slug>/`). This gives us full click analytics independent of the networks.
- **Merchant flexibility:** The `TrackedAffiliateLink` model supports any merchant (Lazada, Shopee, or Involve). We can add more later without code changes.
- **Cookie vs. IP tracking:** Clicks are logged with IP and user‑agent for spam filtering, but privacy‑first approach should be documented.
- **Involve Asia priority:** If we later need dynamic product feeds, Involve Asia’s unified API is the preferred route over scraping or per‑merchant APIs.
